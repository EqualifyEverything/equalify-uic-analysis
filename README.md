# Equalify UIC PDF Analysis

This project includes two key tools for analyzing PDF and HTML pages with the Equalify accessibility scan.

## Components

### 1. Equalify UIC Analysis
This script (`equalify-uic-analysis.py`) performs automated checks on PDF and HTML files. It:
- Analyzes each PDF's size, page count, text content, and tag structure.
- Supports PDFs hosted on direct links, or PDFs on Box.com if you have specfied Box.com API creds.
- Submits eligible PDFs for advanced accessibility analysis via Equalifyâ€™s scan service.
- Submits eligble HTML pages via Equalify's scan service.
- Outputs results to `output.csv`.

### 2. Equalify UIC Dashboard
This Streamlit dashboard (`equalify-uic-dashboard.py`) provides a visual summary of the analysis results. It:
- Displays key metrics like total checks passed/failed and number of files.
- Includes a pie chart and table of failure reasons by description.
- Reads Equalify result JSONs from the `results/` folder.

## Getting Started

### Setup Python Environment

It's recommended to use a Python virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

1. Rename `input-sample.csv` to `input.csv` in the root directory. Add in data within similar format.
2. Run the analysis script:
   ```bash
   python equalify-uic-analysis.py
   ```
3. After the analysis completes, start the dashboard:
   ```bash
   streamlit run equalify-uic-dashboard.py
   ```

Make sure to install required dependencies (see `requirements.txt`) and set your Box API credentials in a `.env` file.
